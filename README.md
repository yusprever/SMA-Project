# SMA_Project
This project was done in a team as part of our Advanced Web Design & Application Class.

We were supposed to create an application in NodeJS for a hypothetical supermarket to calculate a 5 month Simple Moving Average on the supermarket's gross profit and use a charting
library to display it on graph that shows realtime updates as the gross profit grows

For uniqueness we added a login and register page

## Tools
- NodeJS
- HBS and EJS Template engines
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Javascript

## Formulas

### gross profit:

 
  - COGS = Beginning inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory
  
  - Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)


### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
#### How SMA works:

#### Implementation
We used a sliding window algorithm with a fixed window size of 5 to calculate the 5 Month SMA as shown below:

Time Complexity: O(N)
```
 function simpleMovingAverage(profit, window = 5) {
    if(!profit || profit.length < window) {
      return [];
    }
    let index = window - 1;
    const length = profit.length + 1;
  
    const simpleMovingAverages = [];
  
    while (++index < length) {
      const windowSlice = profit.slice(index - window, index);
      const sum = windowSlice.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0);
      simpleMovingAverages.push(sum / window);
    }
    return simpleMovingAverages;
  }
```
